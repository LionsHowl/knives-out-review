The narrative craftsmanship is impressive, as the layers of the mystery are peeled back to reveal deeper complexities and unexpected connections.</p>
                <p>One of the film's strongest attributes is its commentary on class and privilege.

                <p>In conclusion, "Knives Out" is a highly entertaining and cleverly crafted film that successfully revitalizes the murder mystery genre.
